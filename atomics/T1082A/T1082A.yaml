  description: |-
    Griffon is a sophisticated tool believed to be in use by one of more "APT" groups.  This atomic is for detecting, specifically, the reconnaissance part of the tool.
    This script used here was reduced by security researcher Kirk Sayre (github.com/kirk-sayre-work/1a9476e7708ed650508f9fb5adfbad9d), 
    and it gives the exact same recon behavior as the original (minus the C2 interaction).
