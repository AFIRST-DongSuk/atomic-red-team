## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

<blockquote>Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. [1] The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary. [2] [3] Unlike Invalid Code Signature, this activity will result in a valid signature.

Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS/OS X systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform. [1]

Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.</blockquote>
